Admittedly this was disappointing at first, but honestly I think it was an incredible learning opportunity regardless. It’s not uncommon for this to happen at a company edging on the larger side, and it was good for me to practice discipline and to keep pushing through the ambiguity that comes with the deprioritization of a project.</p>\n                <p><b>Building a robust framework</b></p>\n                <p>Using my best judgement, I narrowed the scope of the product and defined design goals. From here, I focused on building a robust framework that would remain scalable for when the project gets picked up again later into the quarter. </p>\n                <p><b>Final product</b></p>\n                <p>Please email me if you are interested in seeing my project more in detail!</p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"3\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"04 - Side project\"\n                subheader=\"Using the Uber app as a platform for change.\">\n                <p>Aside from my main project, I got the opportunity to work with another designer, Nisa Andrews, to put together some mocks of ideas on how Uber can start to become more sustainable and environmentally conscious.

The way that a product operates and the way that a product is engineered in the backend can massively impact how empathetic it is towards users. The user is a topic that should be the north star of every conversation in a company. </p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Nav2 items={['Problem', 'Goals', 'My work', 'Side project', 'Reflections']}/>\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n\n      <NavBar email=\"cathleenjia@berkeley.edu\"/>\n\n\n  </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default HomepointrPage;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
