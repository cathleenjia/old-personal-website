recognizes committed drivers who provide great service.\">\n                <p>To achieve a specific tier, drivers had to earn points while making sure their cancellation rate was low and their star rating was high. Rewards unlock at different tiers, such as priority airport rematches for Diamond drivers, or 4% cash back on gas for Platinum drivers with an Uber Visa Debit Card. My favorite is 100% free college tuition at Arizona State University Online for the driver or their family member, which is unlocked at Gold and after completing 3,000 lifetime trips.</p>\n                <p>The challenge for my project was to design a new part of the program that would help increase long term engagement with drivers. However, due to NDA terms I cannot share any additional specifics of my project. </p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"1\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"02 - Goals\"\n                subheader=\"Going into summer, I was super excited to get a better understanding of the full product design lifecycle. \">\n                <p>And with this internship, I had a couple of goals in mind:</p>\n                <p>The nature of my last internship at Google made my work pretty independent and separate from my teammates’ work. So I really wanted to do more collaborative work. I wanted a taste of working with engineering and product partners and working in a problem space with constraints set by these partnerships.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, I spent my last internship primarily prototyping and experimenting; nothing that I worked on was meant to be sent off to production. My work was done for the sole purpose of learning and gathering insight for the Google Sheets team. So I was really looking forward to working on a project with the immediate potential to launch.</p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"2\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"03 - My work\"\n                subheader=\"Deep dive into building a robust design framework\">\n                <p>Research/audit: I began my work by auditing other loyalty apps and creating a deck summarizing the mechanisms in which other programs enable points earning and points spending as well as the types of rewards that are offered. </p>\n                <p>Defining product goals: I worked with product to narrow down the scope of this addition to to the exiting loyalty program. Some key challenges we faced were differentiating the functionality of this new addition from the existing functionalities - what the unique value add would be.</p>\n                <p>Rapid iteration: With a narrowed scope, I moved on to rapid brainstorming and iteration to see how all these ideas would manifest in the Uber Driver app. </p>\n                <p>Reprioritization of projects: At around this point, some changes had been made to the roadmap on product’s side, and my project ended up getting deprioritized for a bit. Admittedly this was disappointing at first, but honestly I think it was an incredible learning opportunity regardless. It’s not uncommon for this to happen at a company edging on the larger side, and it was good for me to practice discipline and keep pushing through the ambiguity that comes with the deprioritization of a project.</p>\n                <p>Building a robust framework: Using my best judgement, I narrowed the scope of the product and defined design goals. From here, I focused on building a robust framework that would remain scalable for when the project gets picked up again later into the quarter. </p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"3\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"04 - Develop\"\n                subheader=\"I translated my designs into 4 living, breathing prototypes.\">\n                <p>I built a Chrome extension to inject code into an existing webpage, and I built 3 other prototypes from scratch using frameworks built by other UX engineers.</p>\n                <p>I loved how hack-y this role was. What makes this role so different any other software development role is that it forces you to iterate quickly. It teaches you what features you can get away with making crappy, and smoke and mirrors was perfectly acceptable and even encouraged. I had to learn to narrow my focus to a specific interaction. Usually a perfectionist, this taught me to prioritize which features were most important to building a prototype useful for gaining new insight.</p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"4\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"05 - Research\"\n                subheader=\"I created a research plan and conducted 20 user studies.\">\n                <p>I conducted 10 user studies each for 2 of my prototypes.</p>\n                <p>One of the most interesting studies I conducted was with one power user and one new user. They were friends working on the same team: The power user had been working at Google for years whereas the new user just recently joined Google and had been using Microsoft Office up until then.</p>\n                <p>From the new user, I learned that I had made too many assumptions about the user's understanding of what I considered basic functionality. While the new user had difficulty navigating my prototype, the power user found it immensely powerful and applicable towards his current work.</p>\n                <p>This study exposed me to unique problems an enterprise product might encounter -- balancing the simplicity and explicitness required for new users with introducing powerful functionalitys needed by long time users.</p>\n                <p>From these findings, I was able to complete my third iteration. I designed a new interaction that offered powerful functionality but hid it behind a layer of abstraction, making it easily accessible for power users while also reducing clutter on the interface for new users.</p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"5\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"06 - 20% Project\"\n                subheader=\"I also worked on a 20% project with five other UX interns.\">\n                <p>Our prompt was \"the future productivity\". We were encouraged to take a blue sky approach and be as creative as we liked. It was great to work with the other UX interns in defining our problem space and creating a solution together.</p>\n                <p>At the end of the sprint, we presented our research, designs, and insights to the entire Google Docs UX team.</p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"6\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"07 - Planned Parenthood design sprint\"\n                subheader=\"I had the opportunity to help Planned Parenthood redesign their online appointment booking experience in order to remove friction for patients.\">\n                <p>A group of Google designers met with Planned Parenthood designers to come up with new solutions. It was really eye opening in terms of learning about the obstacles that Planned Parenthood faces. We all can read about the policies and legislation that are currently affecting Planned Parenthood's work, but nothing compares to talking to the people on the frontlines of the reproductive movement. The effects ripple so far out and it causing so many more challenges than I had ever even thought to consider.</p>\n                <p>One issue that really resonated with me was that all of the brick and mortar Planned Parenthood clinics are franchised and individually owned. This creates an obstacle when trying to create a cohesive voice or operational system. This was the main pain point we addressed, creating a streamlined online booking system for individually run clinics.</p>\n              </ProjectSection>\n            </Scroll.Element>\n            <ProjectImg imgUrl={require(\"./assets/google/interns.jpg\")} height=\"60%\" position=\"-10% 70%\"/>\n            <ProjectImg imgUrl={require(\"./assets/google/frens.png\")} height=\"60%\" position=\"-10% 70%\"/>\n            <Scroll.Element name=\"7\">\n              <ProjectSection\n                header=\"08 - Reflections\"\n                subheader=\"It was incredibly humbling to get to work alongside such talented individuals.\">\n                <p>I am beyond grateful for this internship experience.
