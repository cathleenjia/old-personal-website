            <h2>I redesigned the website for Halfy Hour, a Berkeley based startup - working on a smartphone application that offers locally sourced food at discounted rates.</h2>

                <b>Local restaurants offer deals</b> at their own choosing, dependent on how many servings they have available or want to make available

              <br>
              <li>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Halfy Hour partners with restaurants to advertise their brand to thousands of people nearby. Restaurants see increased traffic while providing great deals to customers.</p>

          <div class="section" id="section3">
            <h3>Team + Objective</h3>
            <p>I worked directly under the founder and CEO to <b>redesign and simplify the UX flows and UI</b>. I also partnered with remote developers to oversee the project from conception to final release. I hosted weekly Skype calls to check in with progress on implementation.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Unintuitive flows for adding an item to the cart.</b> When quantity of items is incremented from 0 to 1, the item is automatically sent to the cart; yet, the user is still prompted to “Add to Cart.” “Add to Cart” option still available even if 0 items have been selected.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>Inconsistent styling.</b> Buttons vary in style — some are not clearly indicated to be buttons. Text alignment varies as well. Without a cohesive style and layout, the app <b>does not look professional</b>, and <b>users tend not to trust it</b>. Trust is vital when asking for credit credit card information.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Restaurants should be listed with those open and favorited first. Action of scrolling through causes <b>loss of interest and engagement</b>.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Text fields are unintuitive to the user. Pivot towards material design.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Hot pink theme received consensus vote that it’s a rather distasteful choice. Does not agree with the goal of winning over the user’s trust. <b>Rebrand with color choices and logo</b>. Execs would like to continue with fuchsia tones.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                User should be prompted to login before using the app. <b>Do not interrupt experience</b> with prompt later. Execs would like to keep continue as guest option.
              </li>

          <p>I began with a quick sketch of a revamped design.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>Although my design hasn’t had the chance to be implemented since Halfy Hour got acquired, I have assisted in the transition by passing on mockups and assets. This was a short project that I did for fun. Due to the speedy nature of the project, my process was truncated. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from this sprint, including how to divide a page so that when scrolling down the page flows seamlessly.</p>
