            <p class="h1">Hiya I'm Cathleen!</p>
            <p class="h3">Iâ€™m a strategic designer and developer who believes that every design decision should be deliberate and data driven.</p>
            <p class="project-text">I am a third year student at UC Berkeley, majoring in cognitive science with computer science minor. With background in CS, I am adept at designing within systems and at vastly different scales, executing bigger picture concepts as well as creating the fine details.</p>
            <p class="project-text">To me craftsmanship in tech means deep empathy for people's needs, attention to the stories data have to tell, and mastery of the tools.</p>
            <!-- <p class="h3">I have a deep passion for empowering people and enabling ideas.</p>
            <p class="project-text">Currently supporting ideation and creation as an <b>Executive Director at Cal Hacks</b>, UC Berkeley's annual hackathon, hosting over 2,000 attendees.</p>
            <p class="project-text">This November, Cal Hacks 5.0 will be my third Cal Hacks. Year after year I witness so much waste at the event, but this year one of our initiatives I'm personally most excited about is taking the first steps towards becoming one of the first large scale events to go eco-friendly and sustainable. We are starting by eliminating plastic water bottles for hackers and replacing them with water refill stations distributed across the venue and by handing out functional and quality swag that we've deliberately chosen and designed.</p>
            <p class="project-text">I am also transforming health and wellness for kids and older adults as <b>Fung Fellow for Technology and Wellness</b>. We design and build technological solutions to challenges in public health.</p>
            <p class="project-text">I also have the extraordinary honor of being the <b>Sequoia Capital Ambassador</b> for UC Berkeley. Aside from learning first hand from some of the sharpest individuals in the industry, I help inform Sequoia of campus technology trends and indentify high potential startups and entrepreurs.</p> -->
