              <li>
                <b><i>Inconsistent styling. </i></b> Buttons vary in style — some are not clearly indicated to be buttons. Text alignment varies as well. Without a cohesive style and layout, the app <b><i>does not look professional</b></i>, and <b><i>users tend not to trust it</b></i>. Trust is vital when asking for credit credit card information.

              <li>
                Restaurants should be listed with those open and favorited first. Action of scrolling through causes <b><i>loss of interest and engagement</b></i>.

              Moving forward, I would like to design a dashboard for different locations when Halfy Hour expands to San Fransisco. As of right now, it only encompasses restaurants based out of Berkeley simply due to the capacity of the startup. However, an easy to use toggle between cities is crucial for future growth.
