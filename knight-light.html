            <h1>Knight Light Ideation/Business Model + UI/UX</h4>
            <h2>Knight Light is an autonomous drone service for university students. This was created for a design methodology course taken in my fall 2016 semester at UC Berkeley.</h2>
            <img src="assets/index/knight-light--flatlay.jpg">
          </div>

          <div class="section" id="section2">
            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>I worked along side a team of 4 others to see this project from ideation to showcase. We all worked equally in the ideation side of the project. In the later stages, I worked with a partner on the UI/UX end of the project. At the end of this course, we presented at the Jabobs Institute Winter Showcase.</p>
          </div>


          <div class="section" id="section3">
            <h3>Prompt</h3>
            <p>We were given this question to build our product around: <b>How might we improve commuting?</b></p>
          </div>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>

          <div class="section" id="section4">
            <h4>01 — Abstraction</h4>
            <p>We started with a <b>web of abstraction</b>, abstracting the question with potential solutions and problems faced by commuters. We jotted down various versions of the given "How might we", no matter how specific or vague, on post-it notes. These varied from "How might we improve the BART?" to "How might we make commuting faster?". Together, we selected a few questions we wanted to focus on. We also created a diagram of user insights, listing gains, pains, and details about the target user.</p>
            <p>We also drew a web of possible solutions to <b>"improving commuting".</b></p>
            <img src="assets/knight-light/ideation.png">
            <img src="assets/knight-light/web.jpeg">
          </div>


        <div class="section" id="section5">
          <h4>02 — Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>At this point, we had decided to take our prompt in the safety direction: <b>"How might we make commuting safer?"</b>. Our solution entailed an automated drone service that would walk the user home as sort of surveillance system. We researched current solutions, and we accessed the effectiveness of each in a <b>solution selection matrix</b>. Comparing the scores with the projected scores of our idea, we concluded that our product was an idea worth exploring further.</p>
          <img src="assets/knight-light/solution-matrix.png">
          <p>We also did an in depth <b>user experience breakdown for an existing solution</b>.</p>
          <img src="assets/knight-light/existing-solutions.jpeg">
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="section6">
          <h4>03 — Initial Solution</h4>
          <p>With our newly formed idea of an automated drone service, we <b>fleshed out the idea</b> on a white board. As a team, we decided we wanted to make this a service that could be requested via mobile app. We jotted down who our target user would be and their progression through our app.</p>
          <img src="assets/knight-light/whiteboard.jpeg">
        </div>


        <div class="section" id="section7">
          <h4>04 — Interviews</h4>
          <p>With this on hand, we spoke to our target audience. We pitched students our idea and noted down their responses. We conducted a grand total of <b>50 interviews</b> with <b>UC Berkeley students</b> and <b>faculty</b>. Below is an example of one of our customer insights; we detailed who she is, what her daily life looks like, her needs and desires, and, finally, her response to our pitch.</p>
          <img src="assets/knight-light/customer-insights.jpeg">
          <p>In addition to these interviews, we spoke to <b>professionals</b>.</p>
          <p><b>Campus Officer Wayde McAdam</b> gave us insight to competing service, Bear Walk, and the state of safety measures taken currently:</p>
          <p>“Bear Walk was canceled but reinstated by the chancellor out of necessity, in addition to the school not having any money and Wade stating UCB would not pay for such a system.  Wade gets about <b>5 phone calls a day from parents concerned with safety</b>.”</p>
          <p>We also consulted <b>UAVs@Berkeley</b>, a drone club on campus, for technical and implementation advice.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section8">
          <h4>05 — User Persona</h4>
          <p>With insights from our interviews, we created our user persona. Here are the <b>key insights</b> we based this persona upon: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Safe commuting</li><br>
            <li>Irregular Schedule</li><br>
            <li>Tight Budget</li><br>
            <li>Independent Lifestyle</li><br>
            <li>Academic Success</li><br>
          </ul>

        </div>


        <div class="section" id="section9">
          <h3>Low Fidelity Mock Up</h3>
          <p>We flushed out the progression our using our service from start to finish:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Order drone from mobile device</li><br>
            <li>Drone leaves charging station</li><br>
            <li>Drone arrives to our location</li><br>
            <li>Begin route to destination</li><br>
            <li>Customize emergency features</li><br>
            <li>Arrive to destination</li><br>
            <li>Drone returns to charging station</li><br>
          </ul>
          <p>We quickly sketched out a wireframing of the app.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section10">

          <p> Here is a progression of our <b>"how might we"</b> as we approached our final product. As the semester went on, our question evolved depending what stage we were at development.</p>
